# Description
# -----------
#
# Use ANSI codes to apply theme change to all active terminals.  This is
# particularly useful for programs that source their colours at startup,
# requiring a restart to apply a new theme.  All terminals I have tested
# respond to the live theme change.  Tried with xterm, rxvt-unicode,
# {gnome,mate,xfce4}-terminal, kitty, tilix.
#
# Adapted from
# https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/80nidw/bspwm_script_to_change_all_themes_on_demand/duxjw1e/
#
# The ANSI escape sequences are defined in this document
# http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/doc/rxvt.7.pod#XTerm_Operating_System_Commands
